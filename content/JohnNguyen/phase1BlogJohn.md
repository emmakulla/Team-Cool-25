# Arrival into Belgium — And the EU at Large.

This is my first time in the European Union, and, more specifically, Belgium. I must say that what a week this has been. Often hailed as some of the world's best protected democracies and above par quality of life, the EU is heralded by many where I come from to be a model for other nations to follow. Hearing the many speakers reinforce this quality surely has been an invigorating experience. I am seeing first hand how the often long and seemingly unnecessary bereaucratic systems play a role in the EU's stability and a powerful force in maintaining the continent's long-established development. Seeing it in a different light — more of a peace-keeping project — was eye-opening that as far as I know, Europe seems generally peaceful when in reality, that has not been the case for long. However, that's not to say the unique structure of the EU doesn't come without problems. Its infrastrure for innovation lags behind other major players, and while it does standardize the minute details to make an EU citizen's life easier, it is entrepreneurship that takes a hit. Reinforced by the speakers that we have had, this project is still young, and I'm curious to see where else the bloc will go and whether or not other organizations, such as ASEAN or BRICS will seek more robust integration.
