# First Week in Belgium

I arrived in Belgium on Monday, May 12th 2025 for my Dialogue in International Data and Politics through Northeastern University. Ever since, my life has been the busiest it's ever been. I've woken up at around 8 AM almost every day, sometimes earlier. I'm either in class all day or out exploring the beautiful country that is Belgium. So far, I have been to Leuven (where we live), Brussels, Brugge, and Ostend. My favorite city in Belgium so far has been Brugge; it was beautiful with all of it's canals -- even if it smelled liked horse poop in some areas. I also had my first Belgian waffle and it was DELICIOUS! Definitely lived up to the hype. The speakers that have been talking to us have all been pretty good so far; they're actually making me consider changing my career path with how passionately they're speaking, despite the fact that I don't believe I would enjoy their fields _nearly_ as much as they do. Our coursework has started off strong; Dr. Fontenot is really good at making class engaging and ensuring everyone knows what they're doing. We've also finally got more info on our project. It seems really interesting and my team seems pretty chill.  Overall, I'm really excited for the rest of this trip and to work on this project.

# Project Phase 1

I did a lot of brainstorming for this phase of the project. I helped brainstorm ideas for our project, despite not being the one to come up with our final idea. I also helped find the data sources and potential variables to support our main topic of declining birth rate. Additionally, I worked on the user personas. The group worked together to come up with the different personas, and I wrote two of their descriptions. I also wrote the user stories for Cara Day, a daycare owner in France. I also messed with the formatting of our team blog post, though it may still change.
