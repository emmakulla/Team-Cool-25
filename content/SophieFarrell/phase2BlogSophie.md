## Time In Belgium
I'm going to start with May 20th, exactly a week ago, when Phase 1 of the project was due because it was my birthday! I had a really nice day, even though people sang happy birthday to me FOUR TIMES! My professors were super nice too because they bought me a cake! It was technically a tarte so the texture was kind of more like a brownie but it was really good! On Wednesday, the 21st, we had a really interesting speaker come in and talk to use about GDPR, the European Union's main data privacy law. It was really interesting to hear the technical aspect and the considerations necessary to comply with this law. We also had a team bonding activity on Friday: bowling! I am proud to say that in my second game I beat everyone on my team with a score of 115, even Dr. Gerber! I was very proud of myself. On Saturday we went to Namur and saw the Computer Museum NAM-IP. I don't quite know what I was expecting, but it was very interesting overall. There was a lot of retro computers and video games there, and at the end we had a little computer lab where we identified different components of a computer. We spent the rest of the afternoon in Namur, and even though it was raining I had a lot of fun in a board game cafe with my friend Emily. Sunday was a free day and I spent the day in Brussels with Emily! We had a lot of fun window shopping and exploring more than the EU area of the city. Monday and Tuesday (today) were fully dedicated to working on the project. My team and I decided we needed to get in gear and take this project as seriously as we can from now on. I feel really good about our progress and what our project actually does, especially compare to our more foggy ideas from the last phase. I don't have any good photos of last week (but I have plenty of bad ones) so I added a really pretty photo of the Leuven city hall at night that I took recently.

## Project Phase 2
I worked on the wireframes. I created each wireframe that we made for all 3 users, as well as the home page. I looked at the user stories and decided how that would best be translated into screens. I looked through the Streamlit documentation in order to make use of the components that I thought would suit each screen the best. I also worked on updating our user personas. I worked together with my teammates to decide that some of our user stories didn't make complete sense, so we altered our user personas in order to create new user stories that would better suit our goals. An example of this is Eura Peon, who now is considering moving since that it didn't make sense that she cared about another country's parental leave policies beforehand. Additionally, I worked on changing the user stories. Eura Peon and Cara Day each got two new user stories and I worked with my group to come up with all of them. I also looked over the ER diagram after John made the local diagrams for the users. He made them while I had dinner with the professors, so I reviewed them afterwards and offered suggestions, as well as pointed out the lack of ML data in the diagrams. I also reviewed the rest of the diagrams made based on these. After that, I updated our Phase 1 blog so that it reflected the changes we talked about. I wrote the wireframes sections of our phase 2 blog describing the images and what their uses are. I added the pictures of the wireframes to our assets folder and put them on the blog. I also informed the rest of my group that all diagrams/visualizations needed descriptions and our reasoning. I created our phase 2 blog and it's formatting. Additionally, I helped my group members with some git so that we didn't make new branches or update in main every time we wanted to access and edit another group member's edits. Though, Mia's computer is having some issues with using git and just the command line in general, likely due to the major updates her laptop went through based on my minor research. I also wrote the updates section of our phase 2 blog where we described the things we changed from phase 1. This includes our updated user personas and user stories, as well as the new dataset we have added to our project.
