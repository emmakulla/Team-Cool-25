# My Contributions to The Group

For this final phase, there was a lot of work to be done as a group. I focused a lot of time on finalizing the second model. I made several versions of this model throughout the span of a few days before we were able to correctly implement it into the app. One of the components of this model was a working choropleth heat map that shows whcih countries match the best based on the user input. i would say making this was not too difficult as I made a different choropleth map previously for a different function, but working with the CS team to figure out how to implement it definitely took a lot of trial and error. In addition to finalizing the second machine learning model, I also made fixes to the choropleth map I had made in the previous phase that showed the amount of grants each country received in childcare expenses. I changed this so that it showed amounts per capita rather than total amount per country. This changed the output of the map a lot because the output when it was the total amount per country was heavily influenced on the size of the country. 

I also worked on a visualization for Cara Day's persona based on mock data. Emma did complete the visalizations for the mock data though. I also went through all of the visualizations that I created and tweaked them all to fit better in the web app and make sense in context of the personas that they were made for.

In regards to our team blog, I added explanations for the recommendation machine learning model as well as all of the visualizations I did work on. Lastly, we did a lot of practicing for our final presentation to polish it and professionalize it.

I am so excited to present to everyone the product of our team's hard work and incredible effort, and I am so proud of the app that we were able to create!
